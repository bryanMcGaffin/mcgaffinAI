# Manifestation App

This is a minimalistic web app inspired by Richard Dotts' manifestation techniques. It helps dissolve problems and transmit positive intentions to the universe.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. You can use two modes:

- **Dissolve & Manifest** – Add a problem, dissolve it, and replace with a positive intention.
- **Pure Manifestation** – Directly send intentions without the dissolve step.

All data is stored in your browser's local storage.
